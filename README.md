# -Fast-probabilistic-nearest-neighbor-search  (pANN)


ANN – approximate nearest neighbors – is at the core of fast vector search, itself central to GenAI, especially GPT and LLM. My new methodology, abbreviated as pANN, has many other applications: clustering, classification, measuring the similarity between two datasets (images, soundtracks, time series, and so on), tabular data synthetization (improving poor synthetizations), model evaluation, and even detecting extreme observations.
